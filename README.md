## Accessing Sonic

The Sonic Interface supports swapping, adding liquidity, removing liquidity, depositing and withdrawing assets to and from the Sonic canister.

- [Swap on Sonic](https://app.sonic.ooo/swap)
- [Add Liqudity](https://app.sonic.ooo/liquidity/add)
- [View Liquidity](https://app.sonic.ooo/liquidity)
- [Withdraw Assets](https://app.sonic.ooo/assets/withdraw)
- [Deposit Assets](https://app.sonic.ooo/assets/deposit)

## Minting

Besides swapping functionality, Sonic also supports minting of assets. This is done by sending a transaction to the [XTC](https://dank.ooo/xtc/) and [WICP](https://dank.ooo/wicp/).

## Sonic-js

This application is using [Sonic JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Psychedelic/sonic-js) for calculations. You can find examples about how to integrate Sonic into your own application using sonic-js [here]().
